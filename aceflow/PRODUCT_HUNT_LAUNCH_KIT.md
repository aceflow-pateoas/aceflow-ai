#### For Questions About Technical Details
```
Great question! 

[Detailed technical answer]

The core innovation is our PATEOAS architecture that maintains AI state across conversations. You can see the technical details in our architecture docs: [link]

Happy to dive deeper into any specific aspects you're curious about!
```

#### For Comparison Questions
```
That's a fair comparison to [competitor]. 

The key difference is that PATEOAS actually maintains memory and context across sessions, while [competitor] treats each conversation independently. 

Here's a quick example: [specific use case]

Would love for you to try both and see the difference yourself!
